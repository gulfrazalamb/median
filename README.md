# Median Tool

This is a Bash script that calculates the median of a comma-separated list of numbers. It uses the median formula to find the median of the list, and sorts the list in ascending order. The script can handle lists with an odd or even number of elements, and outputs the result to the terminal.
Usage

To use the median tool, follow these steps:

    1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the median.sh script is located.
    2. Type ./median.sh and press Enter.
    3. You will be prompted to enter a comma-separated list of numbers. Enter the list of numbers and press Enter.
    4. The script will calculate the median of the list and display it on the terminal.

Example

Suppose you have a list of numbers: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100. To find the median of this list using the median tool, do the following:

    1. Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory where the median.sh script is located.
    2. Type ./median.sh and press Enter.
    3. You will be prompted to enter a comma-separated list of numbers. Enter the list of numbers 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 and press Enter.
    4. The script will calculate the median of the list and display it on the terminal: The median is: 55.

Notes

    The median tool only accepts comma-separated lists of numbers. Make sure to separate each number with a comma and no spaces.
    The median tool only works with integers. It does not support decimal numbers.
    The median tool assumes that the input is valid. It does not perform input validation or error handling. Make sure to enter a valid list of numbers, otherwise the script may produce unexpected results or fail.
